### What does the second break do in the program?

```go
package main

func main() {
	for {
	s:
		switch 5 {
		case 5:
			switch 3 {
			case 3:
				break s
			}
		}
		break
	}
}
```

1. Error terminate with an error
2. The second break will not work, after the first the program will exit the loop
3. End the for loop
4. Will roll the execution to label s
