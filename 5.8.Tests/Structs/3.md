How to fill all struct field to another package?

```go

package pack

import "fmt"

type Creature struct {
    Name string
    Type string
    password string
}
```

1. 
```go
 c := pack.Creature{
        Name: "King Kong",
        Type: "Monkey",
        
        password: "sec",
    }
```

2. 
```go
var c = pack.Creature
c[Name] = "Alazavr"
c[Type] = "-"
c[password] = "123"
```

3.
```go
 c := new(pack.Creature{
        Name: "King Kong",
        Type: "Monkey",
        
        password: "sec",
    })
```

4.
```go
The password field is non-exportable, so it cannot be changed in variables 
of this structure in other packages.
```
