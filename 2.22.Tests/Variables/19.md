### What is Variable Lifetime?
It is the time interval of the program execution during which it exists. The lifetime of a package-level variable is equal to the running time of the entire program. Local variables, on the other hand, have a dynamic lifetime: a new instance is created whenever a declaration statement is executed, and the variable lives until it becomes unavailable, after which the memory allocated for it can be reused.
